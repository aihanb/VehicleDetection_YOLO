# VehicleDetection_YOLO

Installation pre-requsites:
Keras 1.2
opencv

In this project the following has been implmented:
1. Vehicle detection using YOLO weights,
2. Lane Detection
3. To identify if the car detected is to left or right of the lane
4. Vehicle tracking by comapring the previous image detection details to the current
5. Distance estimation using single camera( based on this idea : https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/01/19/find-distance-camera-objectmarker-using-python-opencv/)

To run the project:

ipython vehicle+detection.py
